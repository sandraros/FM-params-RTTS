# FM-params-RTTS
API (class `ZCL_FM_PARAMS_RTTS`) to get the descriptions of Function Module Parameters as RTTI objects. This API reads the descriptions of parameters from the table `FUPARAREF`, which can be cumbersome to understand, and converts them into RTTI types which are well documented in the ABAP documentation.
